I don't run to think. I run to not-think. And somehow, that's when all the thinking gets done.

This will make sense to anyone who runs. For everyone else: bear with me.

## The Paradox

My job requires constant thinking. Decisions, trade-offs, navigating ambiguity. School requires different thinking — rigorous, mathematical, precise. Both demand focus, intention, cognitive load.

Running is the opposite. When I'm seven miles into a long run through Prospect Park, I'm not thinking about anything. I'm just moving. One foot in front of the other. Breath in, breath out. The rhythm of it becomes almost meditative.

And yet, somehow, this is when insights appear.

I'll be halfway through a run, brain completely empty, and suddenly I'll understand why that system design isn't working. Or I'll see a way through a difficult conversation I've been avoiding. Or I'll realize what I actually want, beneath all the noise.

The thinking happens when I stop trying to think.

## Why It Works

I have theories. Maybe it's the increased blood flow. Maybe it's the physical exhaustion lowering my ego's defenses. Maybe it's just that I finally stop checking my phone for an hour.

But I think it's simpler than that: **running creates space.**

My normal day is a stream of inputs. Slack messages, code reviews, meetings, readings. Even "breaks" are filled — scrolling Twitter, checking email, listening to podcasts. There's no gap where new thoughts can emerge.

Running is a gap. Especially if I leave the headphones at home.

## The City as Backdrop

There's something specific about running in New York that I've come to love. The city doesn't care that I'm running. It just keeps being the city — loud, busy, indifferent. And somehow that's comforting.

I run past people living their lives: walking dogs, arguing on the phone, kissing on benches. I run past the same storefronts, the same intersections, the same trees. It becomes a moving meditation on familiarity and change.

And the city is full of other runners. We nod at each other. A small acknowledgment: *I see you. We're doing this together, separately.* There's a quiet community in it.

## What I'm Training For

Honestly? I'm always "training for something." Right now it's a half marathon in the spring. Last year it was a 10K PR attempt. There's always a race on the calendar.

But the races are almost secondary. They're the excuse, not the reason.

The reason is that running is the one thing in my life that's completely simple. No strategy, no stakeholders, no ambiguity. Just: run. Move your body through space. See how far you can go.

In a life full of complexity, I need something simple.

## A Running Thought

Here's something I've been turning over lately, during runs:

We spend so much time trying to optimize our thinking. Productivity systems, note-taking apps, frameworks for decision-making. And those are useful — I use plenty of them.

But maybe we also need practices that let us stop thinking. Not to avoid our problems, but to create the conditions where our subconscious can do its work. Running is mine. For others, it's swimming, or walking, or sitting quietly in a garden.

The insight isn't in the analysis. It's in the space after the analysis, when you stop gripping so tightly.

Anyway. I have a run to get to.
