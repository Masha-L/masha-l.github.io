This is the beginning of something.

I've thought about starting a blog for years. Always had excuses — too busy, nothing interesting to say, who would read it anyway? 

But here's the thing: I don't need anyone to read it. This is for me. A place to think out loud, to process the chaos of managing teams and studying cryptography and trying to be a human being all at the same time.

So here we are. Hello, world.

More soon. Or not. We'll see.
