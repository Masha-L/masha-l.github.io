      <p>My teams work on the Google Cloud Console experiences for <strong>Spanner</strong>, <strong>Bigtable</strong>, and <strong>Firestore</strong>. These are databases that power some of the world's largest applications — and our job is to make them feel approachable.</p>
      <p>It's a fascinating challenge: how do you build interfaces for systems that handle petabytes of data, millions of operations per second, global distribution — and still make them intuitive enough that a developer can get started in minutes?</p>

        <h3>Cloud Spanner</h3>
        <p class="team-type">Global Relational</p>
        <p>The world's first horizontally scalable, globally consistent relational database. SQL semantics with NoSQL scale. It shouldn't be possible, and yet.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="team-card">
        <h3>Cloud Bigtable</h3>
        <p class="team-type">NoSQL at Scale</p>
        <p>Google's massively scalable NoSQL database service. The same technology that powers Search, Maps, and Gmail. Petabytes of data with single-digit millisecond latency.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="team-card">
        <h3>Firestore</h3>
        <p class="team-type">Serverless Document DB</p>
        <p>Firebase's flexible, scalable database for mobile and web. Real-time sync, offline support, and the simplicity developers need to move fast.</p>

      <h2>The Fun Stuff</h2>
      <p>Some highlights from recent work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI that actually helps.</strong> Led the integration of generative AI into Google Cloud databases — making it possible to query your data in plain English. Built a testing framework to catch when LLMs hallucinate your queries into oblivion. The central NL2SQL team ended up adopting it.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic partnerships.</strong> Led the UX side of a big Oracle partnership bringing Exadata to Google Cloud. No dedicated manager, aggressive deadlines, high stakes. The kind of project where you learn what you're capable of.</li>
        <li><strong>Making databases less scary.</strong> Redesigned Spanner's trial experience — pre-loaded sample data, one-click imports, zero friction. Trial creations went up 32%, conversions jumped 50% in the first month.</li>
        <li><strong>Graph visualization.</strong> Shipped Spanner Graph at Cloud Next. Navigated complex security, legal, and technical integration of a third-party library — instrumental in landing a new strategic customer in APAC.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How I Lead</h2>
      <p>I still write code. I still review PRs. I think the best engineering leaders never fully leave the craft — you lose something important when you do.</p>
      <p>But I've also learned that the multiplier effect of growing others is huge. Some of my proudest moments are watching engineers I've mentored step into bigger roles themselves.</p>
      <p>I organized the first Spanner UI Summit. I co-built an on-call training program that nearly doubled team confidence. I care about process when it enables people, and I kill process when it gets in the way.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Things I Believe</h2>
      <p><strong>Products over features.</strong> Does this actually make someone's life better?</p>
      <p><strong>Clarity over cleverness.</strong> If it needs a manual, we failed.</p>
      <p><strong>Speed with intention.</strong> Move fast, but know why you're moving.</p>
      <p><strong>Growing people.</strong> A team that learns together wins together.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Before Google</h2>
      <p>I spent 3+ years at <strong>ActionIQ</strong>, a NYC startup building customer data platforms. SaaS implementations, cross-functional teams, platform expansion — startup life taught me to ship fast, wear many hats, and never lose sight of what users actually need.</p>
      <p>That's where I learned that the best products come from understanding the full stack and caring deeply about the people who use what you build.</p>
