    <h1>Work</h1>
    <p class="lead">I lead three UI teams at Google Cloud, building the interfaces for some of the most powerful database systems on the planet.</p>

      <p>My teams work on the Google Cloud Console experiences for <strong>Bigtable</strong>, <strong>Spanner</strong>, and <strong>Firestore</strong>. These are databases that power some of the world's largest applications — and our job is to make them feel approachable.</p>
      <p>It's a fascinating challenge: how do you build interfaces for systems that handle petabytes of data, millions of operations per second, global distribution — and still make them intuitive enough that a developer can get started in minutes?</p>

        <h3>Cloud Bigtable</h3>
        <p class="team-type">NoSQL at Scale</p>
        <p>Google's massively scalable NoSQL database service. The same technology that powers Search, Maps, and Gmail. Petabytes of data with single-digit millisecond latency.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="team-card">
        <h3>Cloud Spanner</h3>
        <p class="team-type">Global Relational</p>
        <p>The world's first horizontally scalable, globally consistent relational database. SQL semantics with NoSQL scale. It shouldn't be possible, and yet.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="team-card">
        <h3>Firestore</h3>
        <p class="team-type">Serverless Document DB</p>
        <p>Firebase's flexible, scalable database for mobile and web. Real-time sync, offline support, and the simplicity developers need to move fast.</p>

      <h2>What I Actually Do</h2>
      <p>The job title says "Engineering Manager," but day-to-day looks more like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Building teams.</strong> Hiring, developing, and creating an environment where talented people do their best work.</li>
        <li><strong>Setting direction.</strong> Working with product, design, and leadership to figure out what we should build and why.</li>
        <li><strong>Removing obstacles.</strong> Whether that's organizational friction, technical debt, or unclear priorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Staying technical.</strong> I don't write as much code as I used to, but I stay close to the architecture and review enough PRs to keep my opinions informed.</li>
        <li><strong>Connecting dots.</strong> Three products means three sets of stakeholders, timelines, and challenges. Finding synergies is part of the game.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Things I Believe About Building Products</h2>
      <p><strong>Complexity is the enemy.</strong> The hardest part of building tools for powerful systems is resisting the urge to expose all that power at once. Good design is about what you leave out.</p>
      <p><strong>Users are smarter than you think — and busier.</strong> They can handle sophisticated tools, but they don't have time to figure out your clever interface. Meet them where they are.</p>
      <p><strong>Teams build products, not individuals.</strong> My job is to create the conditions for great work, then get out of the way.</p>
      <p><strong>The best code is the code you don't write.</strong> Every line is a liability. Solve the problem with the smallest possible surface area.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Before Google</h2>
      <p>My path here wasn't a straight line. I've worked on everything from early-stage startups to enterprise software. Each stop taught me something about how to build things people actually want to use.</p>
      <p>The common thread: I've always been drawn to the places where complex systems meet human needs. The gap between what technology can do and what people can easily use — that's where I like to work.</p>
