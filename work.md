# What I Do

I lead the frontend teams for Google Cloud's database products — Spanner, Bigtable, and Firestore. My job is making incredibly complex systems feel approachable. Petabytes of data, globally distributed, millisecond latency... and it should still be intuitive to use.

## The Fun Stuff

### AI That Actually Helps

I've been deep in the AI integration work at Google Cloud — figuring out how to make generative AI genuinely useful for database developers, not just a gimmick. We built systems that let you query your data in plain English, and I spent a lot of time making sure the AI doesn't hallucinate your queries into oblivion.

One of my favorite projects was building a testing pipeline to catch when LLM-generated queries would do something unexpected. The central NL2SQL team ended up adopting the framework.

### Strategic Partnerships

I led the UX side of a big Oracle partnership — bringing Oracle Exadata to Google Cloud. No dedicated manager, aggressive deadlines, high stakes. The kind of project where you learn a lot about what you're capable of.

### Making Databases Less Scary

Product-led growth is a fancy way of saying "let people try the thing without talking to sales first." I led a redesign of Spanner's trial experience — pre-loaded sample data, one-click imports, zero friction. Trial creations went up 32%, conversions jumped 50% in the first month.

## How I Lead

I still write code. I still review PRs. I think the best engineering leaders never fully leave the craft — you lose something important when you do.

But I've also learned that the multiplier effect of growing others is huge. Some of my proudest moments are watching engineers I've mentored step into bigger roles themselves.

I organized the first Spanner UI Summit. I co-built an on-call training program that doubled team confidence. I care about process when it enables people, and I kill process when it gets in the way.

## The Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Products over features** — Does this actually make someone's life better?
- **Clarity over cleverness** — If it needs a manual, we failed
- **Speed with intention** — Move fast, but know why you're moving
- **Growing people** — A team that learns together wins together
