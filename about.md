# About Me

I'm Masha — an engineering leader at Google, where I manage three teams building UI for some of the most demanding database products on the planet: Bigtable, Spanner, and Firestore.

I'm also a part-time grad student at NYU, pursuing an MS in Cybersecurity. Current obsession: applied cryptography.

## Background

I grew up in Moscow and eventually made my way to New York City, which I now call home. My path into tech wasn't linear — it rarely is — but I've always been drawn to building things and solving puzzles.

## Interests

- **Running** — There's something meditative about moving through the city on foot
- **Sustainability** — How do we build a future that actually works?
- **Community building** — Technology should bring people together
- **Poetry** — I write it, though I rarely share it
- **Music** — Learning guitar, miss playing piano

## Side Projects

When I have time (which is rare), I tinker with ideas like:
- A friend reminder app to help people stay connected
- Tools for job seekers

## Let's Connect

I'm always happy to chat about engineering leadership, security, or just life in tech.
