# About Me

I'm Masha — a product-focused engineering leader at Google Cloud, where I lead the frontend teams for some of the most demanding database products on the planet: Spanner, Bigtable, and Firestore.

I specialize in AI/ML integrations and strategic user experience. I've led the full-stack integration of generative AI into Google Cloud databases, built query regression testing pipelines for LLM-generated queries, and shipped features that drove a 32% increase in trial creations and 50% boost in conversion.

I'm also pursuing an MS in Cybersecurity at NYU part-time. Current obsession: applied cryptography.

## Background

I grew up in Moscow and eventually made my way to New York City, which I now call home. My path into tech wasn't linear — it rarely is — but I've always been drawn to building things and solving puzzles.

At Google, I've grown from engineer to tech lead to leading multiple teams, always staying close to the code while taking on bigger challenges. I believe the best engineering leaders never stop being engineers.

## What I Care About

**Building things that matter**
Not features for the sake of features. Products that actually make developers' lives better.

**Staying technical**
I still write code. I still review PRs. Leading teams doesn't mean leaving the craft behind.

**Growing people**
Some of my proudest moments are watching engineers I've mentored get promoted and take on bigger challenges themselves.

## Outside Work

- **Running** — There's something meditative about moving through NYC on foot
- **Cybersecurity** — Currently deep in applied cryptography at NYU
- **Sustainability** — How do we build a future that actually works?
- **Poetry** — I write it, though I rarely share it
- **Music** — Learning guitar, miss playing piano

## Side Projects

When I have time (which is rare), I tinker with ideas like:
- A friend reminder app to help people stay connected
- Tools for job seekers to tailor their resumes
