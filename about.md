    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="lead">I'm Masha — an engineering leader, perpetual student, and someone who believes the best technology feels invisible.</p>

      <h2>The Short Version</h2>
      <p>By day, I manage three teams at Google building UI for some of the most demanding database products on the planet: <strong>Bigtable</strong>, <strong>Spanner</strong>, and <strong>Firestore</strong>. We make petabyte-scale data feel approachable.</p>
      <p>By night (and early mornings, and weekends), I'm pursuing an <strong>MS in Cybersecurity at NYU</strong>. Current obsession: applied cryptography. There's something deeply satisfying about math that keeps secrets.</p>

      <h2>The Longer Version</h2>
      <p>I grew up in <strong>Moscow</strong>, where I developed a love for puzzles, systems, and understanding how things work. Eventually, that curiosity brought me to <strong>New York City</strong>, which I now call home.</p>
      <p>My path into tech wasn't linear — it rarely is — but I've always been drawn to the intersection of complex systems and human experience. How do you make powerful tools feel intuitive? How do you build things that scale without losing their soul?</p>
      <p>These days, I spend a lot of time thinking about <strong>leadership</strong>: what it means to build teams that do their best work, how to create space for creativity in technical environments, and how to stay human in a world that often rewards the opposite.</p>

      <h2>When I'm Not Working</h2>
      <p><strong>Running.</strong> There's something meditative about moving through the city on foot. It's when I do my best thinking — or my best not-thinking.</p>
      <p><strong>Writing.</strong> Mostly poetry, though I rarely share it. The act of writing is the point.</p>
      <p><strong>Learning guitar.</strong> I miss playing piano, but my NYC apartment only has room for so many hobbies.</p>
      <p><strong>Thinking about sustainability.</strong> How do we build a future that actually works? This question lives rent-free in my head.</p>
      <p><strong>Building community.</strong> I believe technology should bring people together, and I try to practice that in my own life.</p>

      <h2>Side Projects</h2>
      <p>When I find the time (which is rare), I tinker with ideas like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A friend reminder app to help people stay connected</li>
        <li>Tools for job seekers navigating the tech industry</li>
        <li>Various half-finished experiments in my GitHub</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
      <p>I'm always happy to chat about engineering leadership, security, the joys and frustrations of grad school, or just life in tech.</p>
