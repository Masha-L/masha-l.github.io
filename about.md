# About Me

I'm Masha. I lead engineering teams at Google Cloud, working on the UI for Spanner, Bigtable, and Firestore — databases that power some of the most demanding applications on the planet.

I'm also slowly losing my mind (in the best way) pursuing an MS in Cybersecurity at NYU while working full-time. Currently obsessed with applied cryptography. The math is beautiful and the stakes are real.

## The Journey

I grew up in Moscow and eventually made my way to New York, which is now home. My path into tech wasn't a straight line — it rarely is — but I've always been drawn to building things and solving puzzles.

At Google, I've grown from engineer to tech lead to leading multiple teams. I've shipped AI integrations, led strategic partnerships, and built features that made databases feel less intimidating to developers. I've also learned that leadership is mostly about creating space for other people to do their best work.

## When I'm Not Working

- **Running** through NYC — it's how I think
- **Cryptography** — the NYU degree is eating my weekends and I don't regret it
- **Poetry** — I write it, rarely share it
- **Guitar** — learning, slowly
- **Sustainability** — how do we build things that don't cost the earth?

I also tinker with side projects when I can. A friend reminder app. Tools for job seekers. Things that scratch an itch.
