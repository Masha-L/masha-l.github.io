      <h2>🎓 Learning</h2>
      <p><strong>Applied Cryptography</strong> at NYU for my MS in Cybersecurity. The math is genuinely beautiful — there's something deeply satisfying about proofs that feel inevitable once you see them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>💼 Working on</h2>
      <p>Leading engineering for <strong>Spanner, Bigtable, and Firestore</strong> at Google Cloud. Current focus: making AI capabilities feel native to database workflows, not bolted on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>🏃 Moving</h2>
      <p>Training for my next race. Still exploring NYC on foot — it's the best way to actually see this city.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>🔧 Building</h2>
      <p><strong>Connection</strong> — a personal CRM for relationships. Because I kept forgetting to check in with people I actually care about, and that's embarrassing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>📚 Reading</h2>
      <p>Always too many books at once. Currently somewhere in the middle of three different things.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>🎸 Playing</h2>
      <p>Guitar — still very much a beginner. Missing piano, don't have one right now.</p>
