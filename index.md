# Hey, I'm Masha 👋

Engineering leader by day, cybersecurity student by night, and a believer that technology should make life better — not just faster.

I currently lead three UI teams at Google, working on [Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable), [Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner), and [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore). I'm also pursuing my MS in Cybersecurity at NYU, because apparently I don't believe in free time.

When I'm not staring at code or reading about cryptography, you'll find me running through NYC, writing poetry that probably won't see the light of day, or trying to learn guitar (emphasis on *trying*).

I care about **sustainability**, **community building**, and making tech more human.
