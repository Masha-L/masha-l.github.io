      <h2>Development</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>VS Code</strong> — tried Vim (too much muscle memory), tried Zed (too new), tried going back to PyCharm (too heavy). VS Code is the Honda Civic of editors and I mean that as a compliment.</li>
        <li><strong>iTerm2</strong> + zsh + oh-my-zsh — because Terminal.app is for people who also use Safari unironically</li>
        <li><strong>GitHub</strong> — yes I work at Google, yes I use GitHub for personal stuff, no I don't want to talk about it</li>
        <li><strong>Figma</strong> — for when I need to pretend I'm a designer</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Languages & frameworks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Python</strong> — my first love, forgives all my sins, runs everything</li>
        <li><strong>TypeScript</strong> — JavaScript but with guardrails so I don't hurt myself</li>
        <li><strong>React / Next.js</strong> — the default web stack because fighting trends is exhausting</li>
        <li><strong>FastAPI</strong> — Flask walked so FastAPI could run (with automatic docs)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>google cloud</strong> — obvious reasons</li>
        <li><strong>Vercel</strong> — for side projects</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase</strong> — quick prototypes</li>
        <li><strong>Terraform</strong> — when I need IaC</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Apps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Notion</strong> — my second brain, except it's actually organized unlike my first one</li>
        <li><strong>Spotify</strong> — always playing something. Silence is suspicious.</li>
        <li><strong>Strava</strong> — if you didn't post it, did you even run?</li>
        <li><strong>Hungryroot</strong> — meal kit that doesn't assume I have 2 hours to cook. NYC apartment kitchens are not for ambitious recipes.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Hardware</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MacBook Pro M3</strong> — fans so quiet I forget it's doing anything. Runs ML models like it's nothing. Will never go back to Intel.</li>
        <li><strong>AirPods Pro</strong> — noise canceling on the subway is not a luxury, it's survival</li>
        <li><strong>Garmin Forerunner</strong> — tells me I'm slower than I think I am, builds character</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Workspace</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standing desk</strong> — I actually use it standing sometimes. Maybe 20% of the time. Okay, 10%.</li>
        <li><strong>One big monitor</strong> — tried two monitors, spent more time arranging windows than working</li>
        <li><strong>Too many sticky notes</strong> — digital tools exist and I still write on paper like it's 1995</li>
      </ul>
